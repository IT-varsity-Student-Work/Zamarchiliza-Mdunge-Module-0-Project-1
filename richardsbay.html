        <p>Richardsbay is located on a 30 square kilometre lagoon of Mhlathuze River, which gives it one of the country's  largest harbours. Richardsbay also has the deepes natural harbours in the African continent. It began as a makeshift habour that was set up by Commodore of the Cape during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. In 1935 the Richardsbay Game Santuary was created to protect the ecology around the lagoon and later by 1943 it expanded into Richards Bay Park. In 1976 Richards Bay harbour was converted into a deep water harbour with railway and an oil pipeline linking the port to Johannesburg.</p>

        <p>Known for its warm lagoon water, Pelican Island is the perfect spot for a quiet family picnic. The waters are also said to be a lot calmer than most beaches on the east coast, which means your children will enjoy taking a dip. You can also enjoy a leisurely morning stroll with anyone while taking in the beautiful views.</p>
