        <h3><u>THE SOOFI MOSQUE</u></h3>

        <p>The Soofi Mosque on the banks pf the Klip River was originally built between 1895 and 1910, but it was greatly extended in the 1960s. As rich as the Islam tradition is in South Africa, nowhere in the country is there a mosque of quite these proportions and such beauty. It makes the visit to Ladysmith much more compelling. The graceful Soofi Mosque is regarded as one of the finest in the country. its fine filigree, stonework, scalloped archways, proud turrets and distinctive minarets - architectural features of the Islamic mosque that looks like tall spires - makes it visually appealing. Known as the Soofi Masjid (mosque), the origins of the marvellous religion bulding date back to 1895 when Hadrat Soofi Saheb regarded as the important Muslim mystic, arrived in South Africa. He made it his mission to build as many as 12 mosques along the the eastern inland of Durban as he could within 15 years.</p>

      <h3><u>LADYSMITH TOWNHALL</u></h3> 
        <img src="images2/ladysmith.jpg" height="400"/>
        <p>Ladysmith has an imposing town hall built in 1893 in the architectural tradition of the time. The building one can now visit is quite the original. The hall became too small and was enlarged in 1923 to accommodate the demands of a growing community. Its historical part in the Anglo Boer War began as the town fell under sledge when it began to function as a field hospital. The Ladysmith town hall has a couple of RML 6.3 inch tower Howtzer cannons of its own as "Castor and Pollux" bought up to Ladysmith in something of a hurry to counter the long reach of the Boer Long Toms. Today you can also see a replica of the Long Toms in the courtyard of Ladysmith Siege Museum, next door to the town hall.</p>
